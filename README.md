# Preparation

######################
##0) make shure the right **[51-android.rules](https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/blob/master/51-android.rules)** exists on your system


this command should show the following content

```shell
$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules 
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1004", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
```
if not, you need to create this file/line, else **adb** can't access your phone

```shell
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1004", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
sudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
```

* make shure you insert the right [Vendor ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#VendorIds), in our case this should be **1004**
* **disconnect the USB** cable between the phone and the computer.
* **reconnect** the phone.
* run ```adb devices``` to confirm that now it has permission to access the phone.

you should see somthing like 

```shell
$ adb devices
List of devices attached 
LGOTMS9db5xxxx  device
```


##1) enable fastboot
At first you have to unlock your Device to install Firefox OS.

*"Fastboot mode is important because it is the first step in flashing custom updated and newer builds of Firefox OS/B2G on our phones. Fastboot is the first step because it is the mode that will actually allow us to flash new images (like custom recoveries new Firefox OS versions) to our devices in a mostly safe manner. Access to fastboot mode simply means that our device is __unlocked__ and ready to hack and modify!"* (quote from [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireFoxOS/comments/3uf92h/fx0_lgl25_fastboot_access_and_information))

1] Enable the **DEVELOPER-MENU** and ADB-DEBUGGING on your phone,  

*Settings > Device Information > More Information > Developer* Menu switch.

2] check adb knows device
```shell
adb devices
```

3] enter schell
```shell
sudo adb shell
```

4] start root
```shell
su
```

5] Backup your [laf](./install_fastboot/laf.img) partition before deletion
```shell
dd if=/dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/laf of=/sdcard/laf.img
```

6] exit su login & adb shell
```shell
exit
exit
```

7] pull the laf backup
```shell
adb pull /sdcard/laf.img
```

8] Enter the shell again:
```shell
sudo adb shell
su
```

9] Erase laf partition
```shell
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/laf
```

10] exit again
```shell
exit
exit
```

11] reboot
```shell
adb reboot
```


12] Enter into FASHBOOT

* shutdown device
* First **hold** down the **VOLUME UP** button and insert a usb cable that is CONNECTED TO A COMPUTER.
Then the Display should show you a [Download-Titel on Black-Background](./install_fastboot/fastboot_menu.jpg)

TWRP is a custom recovery used to install custom software on your Android device.

1] install [TWRP](http://androiding.how/how-to-install-twrp-recovery-via-fastboot/) by [comunity-pre-compiled img](./install_twrp/twrp_2870-madai-a01-recovery.img)

* remove the battery & restart the telephone
* reinsert usb-cable

3] boot into recovery mode, to start TWRP-Menu to see if twrp is installed

##4) install Bluetooth and NFC bugfix for FFOS 2.6
It fixes the bluetooth and NFC issues by:
Flashing a modified boot image that contains an updated ramdisk (kernel is untouched).
This flashable ZIP also fixes the tiny bootanimation problem.



1] connect device to PC via USB and start TWRP
```shell
adb reboot recovery
```

2] copy [fxup.zip](./install_bugfix/fxup.zip) to internal or microSD storage

*when your phone is connect to your pc, you should see the storage in you file browser and could copy the ZIP file easy to the phone*

2] within TWRP install fxup.zip
- *twrp-menu > install > select Storage > sdcard or external_sd  > click fxup.zip* and install it

- don't check the signature verification (ZIP file has no signature)

3] reboot device into ffos and it should work

mount -o rw,remount /
mount -o rw,remount /system
